# Object Detection with YOLO (You Only Look Once)
Welcome to the Object Detection with YOLO project! In this repository, I explored the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for object detection, leveraging the pretrained Darknet model.

## Introduction

Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, with applications ranging from autonomous driving to surveillance systems. YOLO is a popular algorithm known for its real-time object detection capabilities, making it suitable for various real-world scenarios.

## About YOLO

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is an object detection algorithm that detects objects in images and videos by dividing the input image into a grid and predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell simultaneously. This enables YOLO to achieve real-time performance, making it ideal for applications requiring fast and accurate object detection.

## Pretrained Darknet Model

In this project, I utilize a pretrained Darknet model for YOLO. Darknet is an open-source neural network framework written in C and CUDA. It serves as the backbone for the YOLO algorithm and provides pre-trained models for various tasks, including object detection.

## Getting Started

To get started with exploring object detection using YOLO and Darknet, follow these steps:

### Clone this repository to your local machine:

- git clone https://github.com/aditipadhiar/YOLO-Object-Detection.git
- Install the necessary dependencies, including Darknet and any required Python libraries.
- Explore the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to understand how YOLO and Darknet are used for object detection.
- Experiment with your own images or videos to see YOLO in action!
